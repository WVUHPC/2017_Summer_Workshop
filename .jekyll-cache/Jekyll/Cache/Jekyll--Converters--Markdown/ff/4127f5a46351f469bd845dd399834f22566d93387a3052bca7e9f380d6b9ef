    <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.
    Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience,
    and its lessons are domain specific,
    building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.

    create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data;
    work effectively with IT and systems colleagues;
    better understand the use of software in research;
    and much more.
